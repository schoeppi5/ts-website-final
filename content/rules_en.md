# Rules

#### Our rules are are pretty easy and there aren't too many of them. So we would like to see, that everybody follows them!

## 1.Main
1. Keep calm and friendly! All the time! And in case you get salty, keep it to yourself!
2. Everyone has a bad day sometimes, but does everyone has to know about it? Just follow the first rule!
3. **Important:** Do not spam! Not in the chat nor anywhere else! If you get caught spamming you will be banned! So just do not spam!
4. We have a zero-tolerance-policy when it comes to scripts or annoying plug-ins e.g. soundboards or anti-moving-scripts! Using them on our server will result in consequences!


## 2. Administration
1. All admins and moderators paid for this server and we will keep it this way!
2. Every admin and moderator is entitled to kick, ban or punish users in other ways! Punishments, except for banns, that are following these rules can not be undone or questioned! In these cases an admin does not stand above a moderator!
3. If you were falsely banned, please report it [here](report.php). Your reported will be send to all available admins (except you are filing a report against an admin, he will be excluded).
4. If you are reporting something falsely, you will face an according punishment.
